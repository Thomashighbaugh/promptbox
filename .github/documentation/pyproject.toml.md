# Project Level To-Dos

- [ ] TODO add in ability to backup chat logs to Markdown files, as Prompts and Cards are already able to be backed up that way.
- [ ] TODO work on styling the streamlit app with a better custom CSS theme either in app.py or in a separate styles.css file
  - [ ] TODO add pattern or texture to the background of the streamlit app
  - [ ] TODO find a decent set of fonts to use in the streamlit app, both a title font and a body font that are easy to read and still look good.
